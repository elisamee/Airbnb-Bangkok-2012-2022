# From Unnoticed to Unmissable: Improving Review Rates for Airbnb Listings in Bangkok
---

In the competitive landscape of Airbnb, positive reviews are crucial for attracting guests and ensuring booking success. However, many Airbnb listings in Bangkok remain unreviewed, missing out on potential visibility and profitability. This project aims to understand why some listings fail to receive reviews and to develop strategies to optimize the performance of these unreviewed properties. Our analysis is conducted across different areas of Bangkok (inner, middle, outer) to provide specific recommendations.
